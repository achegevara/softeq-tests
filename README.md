Hi there!

You can find the answers for the provided test tasks in the <b>"script.js"</b> and <b>"styles.css"</b> files.<br>
Each solution is commented with a task number so that you could see clear which task it corresponds to.<br>

Moreover I've prepared the index.html file for easier testing.
If you open it in a browser and open a console, you will see some contents both on the page and in the console.

I believe I managed to complete all the tasks.<br>
If you have any troubles with checking the answers or need any extra information from my side, don't hesitate to contact me.
